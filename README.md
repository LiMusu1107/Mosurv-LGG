# Integration of multi-omics data based on deep learning for subtyping of low-grade glioma

This is the code repository of the paper *Integration of multi-omics data based on deep learning for subtyping of low-grade glioma*.<br>
**Mosurv:The classifier for low-grade glioma survival subgroups**<br>
**Cluster：Inferring survival subgroups for low-grade glioma patients.**<br>
**Select_predict_factor:Select predictive factors for the classifier based on the feature importance ranking of random forest.**<br>
**Classfier：Predicting labels for new samples based on Multi-omics algorithm named MOGONET.**<br>

MOGONET algorithm can be found in [MOGONET](https://github.com/txWang/MOGONET).
